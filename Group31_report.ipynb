    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "From 2010 to 2020, the aviation sector experienced a substantial rise in air passengers, significantly impacting global tourism and GDP. The European Union (EU) member states were mainly influenced by the fluctuations in air travel, tourism, and GDP per capita. Lower-income countries proved more responsive to disruptions in air passengers and tourism, while higher-income nations demonstrated greater resilience. Countries like Italy and Spain heavily relied on air passengers and tourism. This study delves into the intricate relationships among these three factors in EU countries, utilizing data from the decade preceding the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure unbiased results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The research employs data analysis and unsupervised clustering methods to unveil patterns that demonstrate the economic behaviors of countries in response to air passengers, tourism, and GDP. Section 2 outlines the data preparation process, consolidating information into DataFrames. These DataFrames form the basis for interactive plots, presenting a comprehensive overview of air passengers, tourism, and GDP in Section 3. This section includes a Gross National Income (GNI) analysis, time series plots, and a correlation matrix, all accessible through the interactive Dash dashboard, which also features a map of Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Section 4, the study introduces K-means unsupervised clustering to categorize countries based on the three aspects. Boxplots provide a detailed examination of each cluster, and hierarchical clustering analyzes similarities between factors. In section 5 a brief discription is given for the dashboard made. The plots in the report are not interactive, therefore, for visualizing the interactive plots, please click on the link in section 5. The research finishes with a conclusion and discussion in the section 6."

After that, the datasets were cleaned, and column names were standardized to improve clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Filtering and Merging\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets were filtered based on specific criteria for each economic factor (traffic, tourism, and GDP). The time periods were restricted to January 2010 to January 2020 to ensure consistency with the World Bank data. The resulting filtered datasets, traffic_filtered, tourism_filtered, and gdp_filtered, were merged into a unified DataFrame. This DataFrame consists of all the indicator information for European Union countries during the specified timeframe.\n",

    "\n",
    "The World Bank is an international financial institution that provides financial and technical assistance to developing countries. Established in 1944, its primary focus is poverty mitigation and sustainable development. The World Bank offers many data sets, from economic indicators like GDP and inflation rates to social metrics such as health expenditure and education levels.\n",
    "\n",

    "Notably, the country code for Greece was corrected, as it had an incorrect code ('EL') for the World Bank library, and the corrected code ('GR') was used. The CountryConverter class from the coco library was employed to convert country codes to ISO3 format and retrieve country names. This ensured consistency and compatibility with the World Bank data package. Additionally, the DataFrame was initialized to store the GNI per capita data for the specified years (2010 and 2020). The most significant part of the code involved a nested loop to iterate over each country and year. The cleaning process was particularly challenging due to the need to filter European Union countries from the global dataset. The resulting DataFrame contains the necessary information, including country codes, names, and GNI per capita values for the specified years."

    "In this section, we use the overview of Gross National Income (GNI) per capita data for European Union countries in the years 2010 and 2020, sourced from the World Bank's World Development Indicators database. The aim is to showcase the disparities in GNI across different European countries and to visualize the average GNI within the EU. The bar plots presented provide a comparative perspective on the economic status of EU member states over a decade. GNI per capita is a critical economic indicator representing the total domestic and foreign output claimed by residents of a country, which includes wages, dividends, interest, and rents divided by the country's population. It serves as a metric for wealth and provides insights into the economic well-being of a nation's residents. The visualizations facilitate an understanding how individual EU countries stand in relation to each other and against the EU average, which can inform discussions on economic policy, resource allocation, and regional development strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "By looking at the graphs for 2010 and 2020, changes can be observed in the GNI per capita for each EU country over the ten years. In both years, there is a noticeable variance in the GNI per capita among EU countries, indicating economic disparity within the Union. The dashed red line indicates the average GNI per capita, providing a reference point against which to measure each country's performance. From the visual comparison, it is possible to identify countries above or below the EU average and assess how their position has changed over time. The graphs can also highlight trends, such as which countries have experienced significant growth or decline in GNI per capita over the decade. It is important to note that the graphs alone do not provide reasons for the observed changes. For a more thorough analysis, one would need to consider additional data and context, such as economic policies, demographic changes, and external economic factors.\n",

    "\n",
    "The in-depth cluster analysis, spanning from 2010 to 2020, has categorized countries into three distinct economic groups based on three pivotal indicators: GDP, tourism, and air traffic. Each cluster reflects an economic profile, depending on the insight of the economic development (GDP), tourism, and air traffic across the countries in the EU. The countries are divided into three clusters. Per cluster, a brief analysis and conclusion are given.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 0: Smaller economies\n",
    "Within Cluster 0 are the countries at the beginning stage of economic growth, resulting in a lower GDP than the other clusters, like Bulgaria, Greece, and Hungary. These countries are geographically distributed in the east side of Europe. They have relatively low tourism and air traffic. However, they have the potential to grow the GDP by incorporating tourism more into the countries, which is currently the case. The air traffic is also on an upward trend to become more connected to other parts of the world. To conclude, the East EU countries are clustered together, with not a single indicator outlier. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 1: Tourism attracting countries\n",
    "The countries in Cluster 1 represent the economic growth countries, signifying the high number of tourism and air traffic numbers, like Spain, Italy, and France. The cluster is geographically distributed in the south of Europe. They can be seen as international tourist hotspots due to their attractiveness regarding weather and attractions. The cluster is known for its moderate GDP. The aviation sector, the air traffic number, has an extensive network for tourists visiting the countries. To conclude, the countries have high tourism, which is correlated to the air traffic number, resulting in a moderate GDP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 2 – Balanced economies\n",
    "Cluster 2 is built upon the more northern countries of Europe, including Denmark, The Netherlands, and Sweden. These countries are known for their high and robust GDP, as seen in the 3D scatter plot. The GDP is not interrelated with tourism and air traffic, concluding that these countries in the cluster have a balanced economy, not depending on tourism and air traffic. The countries serve as robust economies with a high GDP, focusing on other thriving sectors than tourism, like Cluster 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific country Luxembourg is characterized as a unique case because its economic structure does not depend on tourism and air traffic, which is controversial with countries in Cluster 1 like Italy and Spain. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in the hypotheses, high air traffic and tourism do positively correlate with GDP, but not for every cluster. In Cluster 1, it can be seen that, indeed, the GDP is moderately high, and the tourism and traffic also. However, the correlation between GDP and tourism or traffic shows a low number. In Cluster 0, the GDP correlated higher with tourism and air traffic. Cluster 2 does have a high GDP but relatively lower tourism and air traffic, concluding that the three indicators do not correlate highly for every specific country. The second hypothesis is also partly true. It can indeed be seen in the correlation heatmap and the 3D scatter plot that the lower GDP countries (mostly in Cluster 0) show a low correlation between GDP and tourism. However, because of this phenomenon, the countries can be clustered correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the clusters formed on the three indicators show relativeness between them. GDP does not only depend on tourism and air traffic, and the geological distribution also has an impact on the clustering. This model can be used to specify how economic resilience is stated for a country and how the three indicators correlate. \n"
