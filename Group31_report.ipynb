    "We want to begin high level, so tell something about the three factors, then show the timeseries for visualization. After that we want to dive deeper in the correlation between the three factors, so how they interrelate and make a few hypotheses about the correlations. Then we want to implement a K-means clustering to cluster the countries into 3 groups. Then after the clusters are formed, we check boxplots per cluster the see how the data is per boxplot and a hierachical clustering per cluster. Analyze it and state that there can be differences in comparison with the hypotheses. Also heatmaps for each cluster will be implemented for all 3 factors, Traffic, GDP and Tourism. All the visualization will be displayed in a dashboard."

    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "From the year 2010 to 2020, the aviation sector showed a rapid increase in air passengers and the tourism sector flourished influencing the global GDP. Countries in the EU are influenced by the number fluctuations regarding the air passengers, tourism, and GDP per capita. Where lower-income countries are being more vulnarable to disruptions in air passengers and tourism, whereas higher income countries tend be more resilient. Countries as Italy and Spain depend highly on air passengers and tourism. This study aims to deep dive into the interrealtion between the three factors in the EU countries. Using data from a decade before the COVID-19 pandamic, since otherwise biased results are generated. Throughout data analysis and unsupervised clustering methods, pattern are uncovered highlighting the economic behaviors of countries in response to air passengers, tourism and GDP. The EU countries are clustered based on these pattern are will show significant interrelations which can be linked to the social and income class of a country. In chapter 2, the data is prepared and brought into dataframes. Eventually, the data for the three aspects (air passengers, tourism and GDP) are merged into one dataframe is used as the basis for the interactive plots. Chapter 3 consist of the visualization part starting with a general GNI (Gross National Income) analysis to get an insight in each country, followed by the time series plots for all the three aspects, and eventually the correlation matrix. The timeseries and correlation matrix are viewable in the Dash interactive dashboard provided at the end of chapter 3. This dashboard also contains the interactive map of Europe. In chapter 4, the KMeans unsupervised clustering learing can be found. The KMeans clusters the countries based on the three aspects. Furthermore, boxplots are made in order to deep-dive into each cluster. Also  hierarchical clustering is made to analyze the similarities in terms of factors. The last graph is this chapter is the EU map containing the countries of a cluster in a interactive way. Finally, the conclusion and discussion are stated. "

    "This subchapter goes deeper into the correlation of the three aspects, namely: air passengers, tourism and GDP. The three aspects are chosen because they have possible interrelations. However, air passengers and tourism can be related, but this is not always, it could be that tourism is not as high as expected since air passengers only transit in that country. Furthermore, GDP can be linked to tourism since, but could also be a aspect on its own since a certain economys GDP is not affected by the tourism, if there is not that much tourism. After vizualizing the correlation heatmap, multiple hypotheses are generated which will be further elobarated in the upcoming chapters. \n",

The elbow point, point at which K is optimal can be found in the graph, the elbow points lies at 2 to 3. However, 3 is chosen to give more distinction between the clusters. Then, the Kmeans is done and the plot in which the countries are determined by the colors per cluster, can be seen beneath. "
